The SCD4x is Sensirion's next generation miniature CO2 sensor. This sensor builds on the photoacoustic sensing principle and Sensirion's patented PAsens® and CMOSens® technology to offer high accuracy at an unmatched price and smallest form factor. On-chip signal compensation is realized with the built-in SHT4x humidity and temperature sensor.

We've written this Arduino library to make reading the CO<sub>2</sub>, humidity, and temperature very easy. It can be downloaded through the Arduino Library manager: search for 'SparkFun SCD4x'.

Library written by Paul Clark, based on the SCD30 library by Nathan Seidle ([SparkFun](http://www.sparkfun.com)).
